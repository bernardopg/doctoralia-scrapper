## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Development Environment

1. **Clone and setup:**
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd doctoralia-scrapper
git checkout feat/n8n-integration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys
```

2. **Start services:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Verify health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/health
```

### Production Deployment

1. **Use production images:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
services:
  api:
    image: ghcr.io/<org>/doctoralia-scrapper/api:latest
  worker:
    image: ghcr.io/<org>/doctoralia-scrapper/worker:latest
```

2. **Configure environment:**
- Set strong API_KEY
- Configure WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET
- Enable MASK_PII=true
- Set appropriate rate limits
- Configure Redis persistence

3. **Security checklist:**
- [ ] TLS certificates configured
- [ ] Firewall rules in place
- [ ] Monitoring enabled
- [ ] Backup strategy defined
- [ ] Incident response plan

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- Sync endpoint: < 30s response time
- Async jobs: 30min max processing
- Rate limit: 10 req/min default
- Concurrent jobs: 10 (configurable)

### Monitoring Points
- API response times
- Job queue length
- Redis memory usage
- Selenium container health
- Error rates

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

1. **Backup current data**
2. **Update dependencies:**
```bash
pip install redis rq
```

3. **Environment variables:**
```bash
# Add to existing .env
API_KEY=<generate-key>
WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=<generate-secret>
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

4. **Test integration:**
```bash
# Test sync endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/scrape:run \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"doctor_url": "https://example.com"}'
```

## üéØ Next Steps (Optional)

### Custom n8n Node Package
- Create dedicated n8n node for better UX
- Estimated time: 2-3 days
- Benefits: Simplified configuration, better error handling

### Enhanced Monitoring
